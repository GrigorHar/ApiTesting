Unix Timestamp Converter API Tests
This repository contains automated API tests for a simple Unix Timestamp Converter API. The API allows users to convert Unix timestamp to human-readable date string and vice versa.

API Overview
The Unix Timestamp Converter API is a publicly available RESTful API that provides three endpoints:

GET /api/unixtimestamp/converter: returns information about the API.
GET /api/unixtimestamp/converter/unixToDateString: converts a Unix timestamp to a date string.
GET /api/unixtimestamp/converter/dateStringToUnix: converts a date string to a Unix timestamp.
GET /api/unixtimestamp/converter/dateStringToUnixWithFormat: converts a date string to a Unix timestamp with a custom date format.
The API returns responses in JSON format.

Test Framework
The tests are written using JavaScript and the following tools and libraries:

Mocha: a popular JavaScript test framework.
Chai: a BDD/TDD assertion library for Node.js and the browser.
Chai HTTP: a plugin for Chai that provides assertions for testing HTTP APIs.
Prerequisites
Before running the tests, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/.
